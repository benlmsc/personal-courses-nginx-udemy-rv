# We can set multiple worker processes
# Note (1): Increasing the number of worker doesn't necessarily equal to better performance. By default, a NGINX worker
#           process handle requests in asynchronous way, meaning it handle requests as fast as the hardware is capable of.
#           Creating nother workers doesn't increase the hardware's capability. Each worker runs on a CPU core, so in general,
#           we can set the number of processes as the server CPU has.
# To list the number of proc on MacOS, we can use the command: sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu
# Or we can list CPU detail by using the command: sysctl -a | grep cpu | grep hw
# Note (2): By default, NGINX uses 1 worker. But we can set it to auto to spawn one worker to each CPU
# worker_processes 8;
worker_processes auto;

# To keep the configuration valid, we need to kkeep this context (i.e. events)
events {
  # Set the number of connections each worker process can accept.
  # The serve has a limit to how many files can be open at once for each CPU core.
  # We can check the open file limit by using this command: ulimit -n
  # The maximum number of connections is determinated by worker_processes multiplying worker_connections. Each worker
  # process can open n worker connections.

    # Note (1): every location is case sensitive
    # Note (2): Regex match logic has a greater priority than Prefix match if it equal. This means that regardless of the

    #           of their appearance in this config file (cf. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location).
